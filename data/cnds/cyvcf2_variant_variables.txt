ALT : alternate allele (A, C, G, T, or indel nts)
CHROM : chromosome (1-22, X, Y, etc)
FILTER : PASS, or filtration classification. Set as None in cyvcf2 is PASS.
FORMAT :  format of per-sample call data for each genotype in VCF.
ID :  variant ID, if provided in VCF.
INFO : string in VCF containing variant metadata.
POS : genomic position of variant, 1-based.
QUAL : Quality score of variant across samples.
REF : Reference nucleotide(s).
aaf : alternate allele frequency across samples in VCF provided.
call_rate : percentage of samples in which a genotype call was able to be made.
end : end position of variant (as opposed to POS, which is more like start pos).
format : 
genotypes : genotypes for variant, per-sample.
gt_alt_depths : read depth of alternate allele, per-sample.
gt_alt_freqs : frequency of alternate allele in reads, per-sample.
gt_bases : genotype bases, per-sample.
gt_depths : read depth at variant site, per-sample.
gt_phases : 
gt_phred_ll_het : variant genotype phred likelihood (heterozygous), per-sample.
gt_phred_ll_homalt : variant genotype phred likelihood (hom alt), per-sample.
gt_phred_ll_homref : variant genotype phred likelihood (hom ref), per-sample.
gt_quals : genotype QUAL scores, per-sample.
gt_ref_depths : read depths supporting ref allele, per-sample.
gt_types : 
is_deletion : variant is a deletion (True/False).
is_indel :  is variant an indel (True/False)
is_snp :  is variant an snv (True/False)
is_sv :  is variant a structural variant (True/False)
is_transition : is single nucleotide variant a transition (A<->G, C<->T),
                as opposed to a transversion (A<->C, A<->T, G<->C, G<->T)?
                transitions are 2x as common as transversions.
nucl_diversity : diversity of alternate alleles at site.
num_called : number of called genotypes for variant.
num_het :  number of heterozygous gentoypes for variant in VCF.
num_hom_alt : number of homozygous alt genotypes for variant in VCF.
num_hom_ref : number of homozygous ref genotypes for variant in VCF. 
num_unknown : number of unknown/uncallable genotypes for variant in VCF.
